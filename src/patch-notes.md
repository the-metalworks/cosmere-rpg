### Patch 0.3.1 - May 2025

A final pre-release patch, mostly this fixes fairly major bugs and niggles with the system that required workarounds for standard play or were waiting on us to make some direction decisions about the code base.

... Buuut we might also have slipped in a little QoL feature that we were aiming for 1.0 but finished a little earlier! üéâ

## Feature Highlights

### Enrichers are here! ‚ö°

We have now added some custom enrichers for the Prosemirror editors in the system (excluding journals for now). These will provide some much needed relief for GMs wanting to make generic items (or use any of our compendium contents in multiple places when release arrives üòâ) and not wanting to have to manually edit a load of boilerplate text for core functions of the system.

In brief this boils down to:
* You can now type `[[<enricher> <value> <options>]]` in item descriptions and PC notes fields and have cool stuff happen. This will even work in the chat panels
* Current offerings include:
  * a `lookup` that will insert the relevant value into the text where you want it.
  * a `test` tag that prints out a button in the description to quickly roll a skill test for the relevant actor
  * a `damage`/`healing` tag that produces a button which rolls a pool of dice as if they were a damage roll then prints to chat.

Of course each of these has a number of options you can use to tweak the full behaviour, but look at the [full documentation](https://github.com/the-metalworks/cosmere-rpg/wiki/Enrichers) to get the best picture.

For the more techy-minded out there, the interactable buttons are triggering their effects through the foundry Hook system, so feel free to extend these actions them to your heart's content. In future we may even look at having the enrichment process itself trigger a Hook, so watch this space for even more fun stuff!

#### Work In Progress
As this is still early days for us and there will be those of you who have different play and prep styles to us, you may think of something to do with these enrichers we haven't planned for yet, so do get in touch and pass on your feedback, bugs and (hopefully) some praise üòâ
