### Release 2.0.0 ✨
<sup>23rd October 2025</sup>

V13 is finally here! While functionality-wise nothing has changed, this update was a massive undertaking under the hood. 
We've had to overhaul significant portions of the codebase to bring them up to date and while we've got a lot of clean up left to do, this should make future upgrades much easier.

Due to the changes we had to make, everything from version 2.0.0 onwards will no longer be compatible with Foundry V12.

With this release, all of the premium modules have also been updated for V13 so be sure to grab the latest versions if you own any of them!

Thank you to everyone for your patience while we worked through this major update!
