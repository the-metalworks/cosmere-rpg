Instruments are often used for enjoyment, passing time, or busking for chips. When playing an instrument, you can determine the quality of your performance by making a skill test using a related skill (such as <strong>Agility</strong> for a stringed instrument, <strong>Athletics</strong> for drums, or <strong>Discipline</strong> for an instrument with many keys). If you have an expertise in that instrument, you gain an advantage on the test.</p>",
