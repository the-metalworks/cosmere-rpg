Depending on how full the lantern is, it sheds a different radius of light: 60 feet when entirely filled with spheres, 30 feet when half full, 15 feet when quarter-filled, and 5 feet when at least 1 mark or broam is within it. The lock can be opened with its included key or a successful DC 15 <strong>Thievery</strong> test</p>",
