A securely anchored grappling hook grants an advantage on <strong>Athletics</strong> tests made to climb using its attached rope.</p><p>You can use an @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.actions.Item.iqjFbO4BLuTSt4cQ]{Interact} action to attach the grappling hook to an anchor within reach without making a test. Alternatively, you can throw and attach it to a suitable anchor within 20 feet of you by succeeding on an <strong>Athletics</strong> or <strong>Agility</strong> test (DC set by the GM).</p>",
