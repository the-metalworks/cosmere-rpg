This might allow you to catch yourself before you fall, to dodge out of the way of a boulder, or to similarly avoid the danger.</p><p>Make an Agility test to avoid the danger. If doing so in reaction to a test (such as an attack or @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.actions.Item.ttTSR1u5C8D6vbGf]{Shove} action) the DC is equal to that test’s result. Otherwise, the DC is 15. If you fail, you don’t avoid the danger. If you succeed, you avoid the danger to a reasonable degree, as determined by the GM.</p><p>For example, if you’re trying to avoid an area attack from the Division surge, the GM might say you move 5 feet on a success—if this movement gets you out of the area, you aren’t hit, but if the area is larger, you’ll likely still be affected to some degree. The more narrative focused the danger, the more likely you can entirely avoid it, but any potential damage or repercussions are at the GM’s discretion.</p>",
