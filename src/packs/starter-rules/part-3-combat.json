If you can’t decide who should go when, the characters with the highest Speed go first; on a tie, whoever rolls highest on a d20 goes first</span>.</p><p></p><h3>Turn Phases</h3><p>Each round of combat follows this sequence:</p><ol><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Fast PC Turns.</strong> </span>Any PCs who want a fast turn go in any order, gaining two actions each (plus one reaction).</p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Fast NPC Turns.</strong> </span>The GM chooses which adversaries or other NPCs want a fast turn and decides what order they go in.

(Some talents and other abilities can grant an additional reaction.)</p><p>Each reaction lasts until the start of your next turn (or until you use it). You can use it to respond to specific triggers at any point in a round, either on or off your turn; this represents your ability to instinctively respond to someone or something on the battlefield.</p><p></p><h4><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Gaining Actions</strong></span></h4><p>At the start of each of your turns, you gain a certain number of actions<span class=\"fontstyle3\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\">(</span><span class=\"cosmere-icon\">1</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\">)</span>, which represent tasks you can undertake only on your turn.

When you do, deal damage equal to the total rolled on the damage dice.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Hit.</strong> </span>If your test succeeds, you <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>hit</strong></span> the target. Deal damage equal to the total rolled on the damage dice + your modifier for the skill you used for the test.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Critical Hit.</strong> </span>When you hit with an attack, you can find a weakness by spending<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"cosmere-icon\" style=\"color:rgb(19,89,173)\">O</span>, changing the hit into a <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>critical hit</strong></span>. This maximizes the result of your damage dice against all targets of that attack: treat all damage dice as if they rolled their highest number.</p><p></p><table class=\"sl-blue\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"sl-blue-header\" data-colwidth=\"538\"><p><strong>Damage Types and Deflect Value</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"sl-blue-text\" data-colwidth=\"538\"><p>Each attack specifies the type of damage it deals.

For more information on damage types, see @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.4BfYSQ4DinrH4dPa.JournalEntryPage.g3I4elHd7V9Zc9g0]{Damage, Injury, and Death} in part 2.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Weapon Attacks</span></h2><p>The most common way to attack is using a weapon, usually via the Strike action or your talents. When you make a weapon attack, choose either an unarmed attack or a weapon you’re currently wielding in your hand. The Weapons table in part 6 specifies which skill to test and which damage dice to roll for each weapon.</p><p>To attack a target with a weapon, they must be within your reach (for melee attacks) or within the weapon’s specified range (for ranged attacks), and they must be in your line of effect (see @UUID[.notytnLjsp80olVs]{Targeting and Range}).</p><p></p><div><p><strong>Wielding Multiple Weapons.</strong> Chapter 7 of the <em>Stormlight Handbook</em> presents rules for making attacks using weapons in your main hand and offhand.</p><p><strong>Unarmed and Improvised Weapon Attacks. </strong>Though not made with standard weapons, rules for unarmed attacks and improvised weapon attacks are presented in the \"Weapons\" section of part 6.</p><p></p><h2>Melee Attacks</h2><p>Attacks against targets next to you are <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>melee attacks</strong></span>. These must be made against a target within your reach—typically within 5 feet of you, as described in the upcoming @UUID[.notytnLjsp80olVs#effect-range]{Effect Range} section. Some weapons extend your reach further.</p></div><p>If you use a ranged weapon to attack a target next to you, this isn’t considered a melee attack; see @UUID[.iQUOQW4Mxgj7HSQ6#ranged-attacks-and-reach]{Ranged Attacks and Reach} for these attacks.</p><p>If your melee weapon has the Thrown trait, you can also use it to make a ranged attack.</p><p></p><h2>Ranged Attacks</h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Ranged attacks</strong></span> include firing ranged weapons, throwing weapons with the Thrown trait, or even Lashing objects toward your opponent with Stormlight. These must be made against a target within the weapon or attack’s specified range (see @UUID[.notytnLjsp80olVs]{Targeting and Range}).</p><p></p><h3>Ranged Attacks and Reach</h3><p>When you make a ranged attack while you’re within reach of any enemy, your attack gains a disadvantage, as you must carefully avoid giving the nearby enemy an opening.</p><p>When you make a ranged attack against a target who is within 5 feet of your ally, raise the stakes on the attack test. If this attack misses your target and you roll a Complication, the GM can spend it to make your attack automatically graze your ally (without spending focus).</p><p></p><h3>Unstable Footing</h3><p>If you have<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>unstable footing</strong></span>—such as when swimming, flying in open air, or standing on a precarious perch—your ranged attack gains a disadvantage, as you must carefully stabilize yourself.</p><p></p><h2>Attacks With Multiple Targets</h2><p>Some attacks have multiple targets. For these attacks, roll your attack test and damage dice once as usual, then compare the results to the corresponding defense of each target, determining the result for each target individually. To graze multiple characters who you missed, you must spend 1 focus per target you want to graze.</p><p></p><h3>Area Attacks</h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Area attacks</strong> </span>target all characters (or a specified subset of characters) within a physical area. Many surges allow you to make these powerful attacks, as do a few other abilities. When you make an area attack, follow the above rules for attacking multiple characters, and refer to the upcoming @UUID[.notytnLjsp80olVs]{Targeting and Range} section to determine the effect’s area.</p><p></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:16pt\">Creative Maneuvers</span></h2><p>Adding variety to combat is fun, whether you’re disarming your foe or pinning their hand to the table. To keep things simple, this game doesn’t provide separate rules for a long list of combat maneuvers, but that doesn’t mean they can’t be part of your story.</p><p>In general, if you want to execute a creative maneuver with your weapon, that falls under the Strike action (see @UUID[.lws4hcoJ4uAqLqxU]{Actions and Reactions} earlier in this chapter). When you Strike, describe how you want to attack; if the GM agrees your maneuver is possible, they’ll choose a defense for you to target (and potentially add one or more disadvantages, depending on how complex your maneuver is). If this attack test succeeds, the GM determines any narrative or mechanical effects of your maneuver (in addition to the normal damage dealt).</p><p>Heavy weapons tend to favor maneuvers that damage things in the environment, drive back foes, or otherwise take advantage of the weapon’s weight and reach. When testing Heavy Weaponry, the GM might apply fewer disadvantages to maneuvers that exploit these strengths.</p><p>Light weapons tend to favor precise maneuvers like cutting an important item free of the target’s belt or targeting a specific part of their body. When testing Light Weaponry, the GM might apply fewer disadvantages to these sorts of maneuvers.</p><p>For example, you might want to disarm your foe by thrusting precisely at their sword arm. If the GM agrees that maneuver makes sense, they might ask you to attack against your foe’s Cognitive defense, gaining one disadvantage if you’re using a light weapon, or two disadvantages if you’re using a heavy weapon.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p3-combat/pg307_Honor%20is%20dead_ARI%20IBARRA.webp\" alt=\"Honor%20is%20dead_ARI%20IBARRA\" style=\"border:0px\" class=\" centered\" width=\"600\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Ari Ibarra</strong></p></div>"

                "content": "<div class=\"sl-journal\"><p>Many attacks, talents, and other abilities can only affect certain types of characters or objects, or only affect targets within a certain distance. Some of the following limitations primarily matter in combat, but if you’re using an ability in a conversation or endeavor, it’s up to the GM whether the same rules apply. <br /></p><h2>Targeting Characters and Objects</h2><p>If you want to directly apply a mechanical effect to a character or object (for example, restoring health, applying a condition, or otherwise altering their statistics), the following restrictions apply. As always, it’s up to the GM to decide what best fits the narrative; they might allow you to target something the rules don’t officially allow, or they might decide that in the current situation, you can’t reasonably affect a target regardless of the rules.</p><p></p><h3>Line of Effect</h3><p>Many abilities can’t be used if there are obstructions between you and your target. When an ability says you need a <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>line of effect</strong></span> to your target, you can only target that character or object if an imaginary straight line could directly connect any part of your body to any part of the target without touching a solid object or passing through an unreasonably small opening (such as a crack in the door; this size is up to the GM’s discretion).</p><p></p><h3>Locating and Sensing Targets</h3><p>Unless an effect otherwise specifies, you can only target a specific character or object if you know they’re in a certain location within range.</p><p>If you believe you know where a target is but you can’t sense them to confirm, you gain a disadvantage on attacks and other tests targeting them that affect their physical body. Attack tests made in this way can’t graze.</p><p>You can only test in this way if you’re aware of the target’s existence and potential location through other means (such as peering into Shadesmar or being told of their position).</p><p></p><h3>Influencing a Target</h3><p>Some effects require you to be able to<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>influence</strong></span> your target. To do so, your target must be within a reasonable communication distance, be able to sense you, and be able to interpret the intent of your gestures, vocalizations, or similar communication. Unless otherwise pecified, you don’t need to share a language, as you can make your intent clear through pointing commandingly, gesturing rudely, shouting encouragingly, and so on. See the @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.LIl38TXSOlUmIZsA.JournalEntryPage.XkVcuqegUYwaVnbb#resisting-mechanical-effects]{Resisting Mechanical Effects} section of part 4 for more details.</p><p></p><h2>Effect Range</h2><p>Many abilities limit how far away you can apply their effects. All attacks are restricted to a certain range, as are most other tests and effects.</p><p></p><h3>Range</h3><p>Some abilities allow you to apply effects from a distance. These effects state a specific<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>range</strong></span>—the farthest that effect can reach from its origin (which is usually you). Most abilities with range restrictions provide the range in that ability’s text. However, the range of weapon attacks depends on the weapon you use.</p><p></p><h4><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Long and Short Range</strong></span></h4><p>All ranged and thrown weapons, as well as some abilities, specify both a short range and a long range (usually expressed in feet and separated by a slash). Tests within the <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>short range</strong> </span>are made as usual, but tests in the <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>long range</strong> </span>gain a disadvantage.</p><p>For example, an axe with a range of [20/60] has a short range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. You can’t use that axe to attack characters more than 60 feet away from you, and if you attack a character more than 20 feet away from you, the test gains a disadvantage.</p><p></p><h3>Reach</h3><p>Some abilities—and all melee attacks—require your target to be within <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>reach</strong></span>; this applies whether you’re reaching them using arms, claws, other appendages, weapons, or surges. This special range includes anywhere that’s both in your line of effect and within 5 feet of your space (see @UUID[.rMs5NOkzGPLSbj9y#size-and-space]{Size and Space} later in this chapter). Some weapons and effects can increase your reach beyond 5 feet, but no matter the distance, you must still have line of effect.</p><p></p><h2>Area Effects</h2><p>Some surges and other abilities can affect any character (or a specified subset of character) in a large physical area. Such <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>area effects</strong> </span>specify that physical area’s size, usually in feet. This is often expressed as a square (“each character in a 10-foot square”) or as a distance from an origin point (“each character within 5 feet of the fabrial”). However, these are abstractions for simplicity; areas typically don’t need to be a perfect square or circle, and the GM is free to describe the effect and make exceptions in ways that make sense for that ability.</p><p>Within reason, each character whose space roughly overlaps with an area effect is affected. For example, even though a 10-foot square is technically two-dimensional, a character standing on a stool above ground level usually experiences the same area effect as a character sitting on the ground, as long as it fits the story.</p><p></p><h3>Placing Area Effects</h3><p>When an ability allows you to choose an effect’s area, you can place that area anywhere one of its edges touches the maximum range of the effect. For example, if an effect targets “a 10-foot square within your reach,” the entire 10-foot square doesn’t need to be within your reach, as long as you can touch one corner of it.</p><p></p><h3>Area Effects and Senses</h3><p>Because area effects create a phenomenon in a physical area regardless of who is in it, you can use them even if you can’t sense any characters or objects within the area. (This is different from effects where you choose a specific character or characters; such effects typically require you to sense the target or at least know they exist.)</p><p></p><h3>Area Effects and Barriers</h3><p>Most area effects can’t penetrate solid obstacles like walls, but it’s up to the GM to decide whether an effect could reasonably extend past an obstacle or curve around a corner.</p></div>"

However, for more complex fights, some groups find that visual aids help them to keep track of the action and keep everyone on the same page.</p><p>In these cases, the GM commonly uses a set of<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>miniatures</strong> </span>to represent characters and a square <strong>g</strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>rid</strong> </span>to track distances and positioning. When playing in person, GMs often draw on large, erasable vinyl maps (available online or at your local hobby store). Terrain and obstacles can be drawn on the grid or represented by three-dimensional terrain. When playing online, GMs often use a virtual tabletop to display the terrain and character tokens.</p><p>If you’re using a square grid to re<span class=\"fontstyle0\">present your combat, the following sections provide guidance on adapting this book’s rules to work with a grid.</span></p><p></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(30,60,96);font-size:16pt\">Tactical Grid</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Most groups use a grid of 1-inch squares. This size works with the Stormlight miniatures as well as most commercially available roleplaying miniatures.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">On this size of grid, each side of a square represents 5 feet. Most sizes, distances, and ranges in this game are divisible by 5, making them translate easily to this size. For example, a Medium character or effect fills a single 5-foot square.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Some groups prefer to use a hexagonal grid; these work much like a square grid but allow more realistic and flexible movement.</span></p><p></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Movement</span></h2><p>When moving your character, you move from square to square (or hexagon to hexagon) on the grid. Each new square represents you moving 5 feet. Regardless of whether you move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, it costs the same 5 feet of movement. (While the diagonal is technically longer, this rule dramatically simplifies movement during play.)</p><p>To enter a square, you must have at least 5 or more feet of movement remaining (or 10 or more if you are Slowed).</p><p></p><h3>Corners</h3><p>You can’t move diagonally if you’d cross a corner that’s obstructed by an enemy, wall, or other terrain feature that blocks the square.</p><p></p><h2>Range and Line of Effect</h2><p>To determine your range or distance to other combatants, count the shortest route from you to the object as if you were moving there. If making a ranged attack, ignore obstacles that your projectile can reasonably fly over.</p><p>To determine whether another square is in your line of effect (see the earlier @UUID[.notytnLjsp80olVs]{Targeting and Range} section), draw an imaginary line from a corner of your square to any corner of that square. If you can draw that line without passing <span class=\"fontstyle0\">through or touching a solid object, that square is in your line of effect.</span></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p3-combat//pg312_Line%20of%20Effect%20diagram.webp\" alt=\"Line%20of%20Effect%20diagram\" style=\"border:0px\" class=\" centered\" width=\"600\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Red (No Line of Effect), Green (Line of Effect)</strong></p><p></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(30,60,96);font-size:16pt\">Sizes and Areas of Effect</span></h2><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Each character’s space (see the earlier </span>@UUID[.rMs5NOkzGPLSbj9y#size-and-space]{Size and Space}<span class=\"fontstyle0\"> section) fills a square or squares based on their size. If a miniature you’re using doesn’t quite match up to those dimensions, that’s okay—for simplicity, just use the footprint of the miniature to determine how many squares it takes up on the battlefield. However, use the character’s in-game size for calculating all other rules.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">When determining areas of effect, their dimensions are outlined in increments of 5 feet, aligning to the lines of the grid. When determining an effect’s point of origin, you can start the effect in any space adjacent to a space you occupy (the area doesn’t need to include your space). For example, if you target a large area with the Division surge, only one square of that area needs to be next to your square; the rest can extend much farther away from you.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If an effect only impacts a Small (2.5-foot diameter) area, it generally still affects one entire 5-foot square since that is the grid’s smallest increment—but the GM might take some creative liberties with resolving the outcome when it suits the narrative.</span></p></div>"
