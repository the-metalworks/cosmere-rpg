While wielding a weapon, you can use it to attack or use other abilities. Rules that apply to “your weapon” only apply if you’re wielding that weapon.</p><p>If you aren’t wielding a weapon (or holding an object) in a hand, you have that<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>hand free</strong> </span>for other abilities that require it. If both of your hands are full but an ability doesn’t state you need a hand free, it’s up to the GM to decide whether you could reasonably use that ability in the narrative.</p><p></p><h3>Drawing Weapons</h3><p>You can use the Interact action to draw a weapon in your possession and grasp it in your hand. After you do, you’re wielding that weapon and can use it for attacks and other effects.</p><p>You can use the Drop free action to release a weapon you’re holding (for example, right before you Interact to draw a different weapon). When a scene begins and you’re not @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.4BfYSQ4DinrH4dPa.JournalEntryPage.jQvh7ULoKmh49sYA#surprised]{Surprised}, it’s assumed you can instinctively draw your weapons before the first round (without using the Interact action).</p><p></p><h3>Offhand Weapons</h3><p>While wielding more than one weapon, you must choose which one is in your <span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>main hand</strong></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\">. </span>Attacks with that weapon are made as usual.</p><p>When you wield a weapon that’s not in your main hand, it’s in your<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>offhand</strong>. </span>Before you use the Strike action using a weapon in your offhand, you must spend 2 focus. (Attacks other than the Strike action don’t require spending that focus.)</p><p>Some characters might wield their weapons using methods other than hands. You can do this if you’re only wielding weapons that another character could with two hands. <span class=\"fontstyle0\">When you do, pick which weapon is considered your “main hand” and “offhand” (regardless of how you hold them), and otherwise follow the weapon rules. Unless your GM decides otherwise, you can’t wield more than two weapons (or one Two-Handed weapon) at a time, regardless of whether you use your hands to do so.</span></p><p></p><h3>Ammunition</h3><p>If your weapon has the Loaded or Ranged trait, you don’t need to purchase its ammunition or track it on your character sheet (unless the weapon uses special ammunition). However, the Loaded trait does limit how many shots you can make w<span class=\"fontstyle0\">ith a weapon before reloading. It’s assumed you can always obtain or improvise standard ammunition for your weapons, unless the GM decides you’re in an unusual situation where ammunition is unavailable</span>.</p><p></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p6-items/pg47_ITEM_Arrow_VINCENT%20DUTRAIT.webp\" alt=\"An arrow with fletching made from leaves.\" style=\"border:0px\" class=\" centered\" width=\"500\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Most Rosharan arrows are fletched with grass blades or scragglebark</strong></span><strong> - </strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Vincent Dutrait</strong></span></p><p></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Weapon Range</span></h2><p>Weapons can only attack targets within a certain range.

On the Weapons table, if a melee weapon’s range lists a number in brackets, increase your reach by that many feet. For example, if you usually have a 5-foot reach, a Melee [+5] weapon extends your reach to 10 feet.</p><p></p><h3>Ranged Weapons</h3><p>You can fire ammunition from a<span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"color:rgb(36,32,33);font-size:10pt\"> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>ranged weapon</strong></span> that you’re wielding, attacking a target either within or beyond your reach. The weapon’s range lists two numbers in brackets, such as Ranged [80/320]; the first number is the weapon’s short range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range in feet. As described in @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.GgQySBa2DAqiGFNq.JournalEntryPage.notytnLjsp80olVs]{Targeting and Range} in part 3, ranged attacks outside short range gain a disadvantage.</p><p>Additionally, as described in @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.GgQySBa2DAqiGFNq.JournalEntryPage.iQUOQW4Mxgj7HSQ6]{Attacking} in part 3, you gain a disadvantage on ranged attacks while within an enemy’s reach.

Each injury can be treated with anesthetic only once per day.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Antiseptic (potent).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Knobweed milk, fourleaf sap, and lister’s oil can all be used to make a strong antiseptic. A dose can be applied to a character after a short rest to restore [[/r 2d6]] health</span>.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Antiseptic (weak).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A dose of weak antiseptic, such as that made from larmic mucus, can be applied to a character after a short rest to restore [[/r 1d6]] health.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Book (reference).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Each reference book contains information on a particular topic, such as a historical era, engineering, biology, architecture, or crafting a particular type of fabrial. When you have time to reference a book while making a related test using your Intellect attribute, you’re considered to have an expertise in the topic (see </span>@UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.dCOrLZj5O9Va7cd3.JournalEntryPage.FL2CI9SgUjr5oHGM#expertise-benefits]{Expertise Benefits}<span class=\"fontstyle2\"> in part 1).</span></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p6-items/pg53_ITEM_Book_VINCENT%20DUTRAIT.webp\" alt=\"A hand-bound leather book with a wrapped cover and clasp, onto which a note has been affixed.\" style=\"border:0px\" class=\" centered\" width=\"200\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Book (reference) - VINCENT DUTRAIT</strong></p><p></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Candle.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While lit, the candle sheds light in a 15-foot radius. It burns for up to 6 hours before becoming unusable.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Case (leather).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A sealable, cylindrical case that can store up to ten pages of paper or parchment and protect them from the weather.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Chain (thick).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This sturdy chain can be used in securing cargo, shackling prisoners, and other situations where strength is essential. This chain can be broken by succeeding on a DC 30 Athletics test or by dealing 15 damage to it.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Chain (thin).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This thin chain is often used in jewelry and Soulcasters, usually made of precious metals in fine links. This chain can be broken by succeeding on a DC 20 Athletics test or by dealing 5 damage to it.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Clothing (common).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Plain clothes are made of affordable materials and are generally undyed, helping you fit in among the commonfolk. While wearing these clothes, you gain an advantage on spiritual tests made to convince others you’re from the lower class.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Clothing (fine).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Fine clothes are made of silks or other high-quality materials, colored using expensive dyes, and often stitched with fine embroidery. Wearing fine clothes helps you to blend into high society, such as noble banquets, without arousing suspicion. While wearing these clothes, you gain an advantage on spiritual tests made to convince others you’re from the upper class.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Clothing (ragged).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This clothing may have once been of fine or common make, but it’s now barely holding together. While wearing these clothes, you gain an advantage on spiritual tests made to convince others you’re destitute.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Crowbar.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use a crowbar to gain an advantage on Athletics tests where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Ear Trumpet.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Distant sounds heard through an ear trumpet can be perceived as though at half the distance. At the GM’s discretion, more powerful ear trumpets may be available at higher prices.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Flint and Steel.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A flint and steel can be used as </span><span class=\"cosmere-icon\">1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> to light abundant fuel within reach. Starting a fire under more challenging circumstances can take 1 minute or more. Herdazians often wear a tool called a sparkflicker as jewelry or other ornamentation; they can use this like flint and steel by quickly running their crystalline fingernails along it.</span></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p6-items/pg54_ITEM_Sparkflicker_VINCENT%20DUTRAIT.webp\" alt=\"A ring meant to be worn across two fingers, across which a steel plate has been fashioned.

They generally lack flavor, but if kept dry, they remain edible indefinitely.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Food (street).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Every culture of Roshar has its own street confections, ranging from loaves of bread to more specific cultural foods like Herdazian chouta.</span></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p6-items/pg54_ITEM_Food_VINCENT%20DUTRAIT.webp\" alt=\"A trio of leaf-wrapped packages, held in place by toothpicks.

A securely anchored grappling hook grants an advantage on Acrobatics and Athletics tests made to climb using its attached rope.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use an @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.actions.Item.iqjFbO4BLuTSt4cQ]{Interact} action to attach the grappling hook to an anchor within reach without making a test. Alternatively, you can throw and attach it to a suitable anchor within 20 feet of you by succeeding on an Athletics or Agility test (DC set by the GM).</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lantern (oil).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">While lit, this lantern sheds light in a 30-foot radius. It burns for up to 6 hours per pint of oil.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lantern (sphere).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This lantern includes a locked cage, usually just under 1 foot in diameter, into which infused spheres can be placed to shed light. Depending on how full the lantern is, it sheds a different radius of light: 60 feet when entirely filled with spheres, 30 feet when half full, 15 feet when quarter-filled, and 5 feet when at least 1 mark or broam is within it. The lock can be opened with its included key or a successful DC 15 Thievery test.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lock and Key.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This sturdy lock can be opened with its included key or a successful DC 20 Thievery test. At the GM’s discretion, locks that require higher DCs may be available at higher prices.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lockpick.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use a lockpick to gain an advantage on Thievery tests made to pick a lock. After this test is resolved, the GM can spend </span><span class=\"cosmere-icon\" style=\"color:rgb(173,19,19)\">C</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> to cause the lockpick to break.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Magnifying Lens.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You can use a magnifying lens to gain an advantage on skill tests made to appraise or inspect a small or highly detailed item.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Manacles.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">These metal restraints, which come with a key, can bind the wrists or ankles of a Large or smaller character. They can be escaped with a successful DC 25 Agility test, broken by succeeding on a DC 25 Athletics test or by dealing 15 damage to them, or lockpicked by succeeding on a DC 20 Thievery test. At the GM’s discretion, manacles that require higher DCs may be available at higher prices.</span></p><p></p><img src=\"systems/cosmere-rpg/assets/art/p6-items/pg54_ITEM_Manacles_VINCENT%20DUTRAIT.webp\" alt=\"A pair of heavy steel manacles with a large brass key.\" style=\"border:0px\" class=\" centered\" width=\"250\" /><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Manacles - VINCENT DUTRAIT</strong></p><p></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Musical Instrument.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Every culture of Roshar has its preferred instruments and musical stylings. Instruments are often used for enjoyment, passing time, or busking for chips. When playing an instrument, you can determine the quality of your performance by making a skill test using a related skill (such as Agility for a stringed instrument, Athletics for drums, or Discipline for an instrument with many keys). If you have an expertise in that instrument, you gain an advantage on the test</span>.</p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Net (hunting).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This net of thick rope can ensnare animals or enemies. While holding this net, you can use </span><span class=\"cosmere-icon\">1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"> to make an Athletics test against the Physical defense of a Large or smaller character within 15 feet of you. On a hit, the character is Restrained and knocked Prone. That character or another within reach can use the Interact action to make a DC 15 Athletics test, freeing the trapped character on a success. If a character is Restrained by multiple nets, they must be freed from each separately.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Net (fishing).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This net of fine mesh is used to ensnare fish. You can use this net to gain an advantage on physical tests related to fishing.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Oil.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Oil generally comes in a 1-pint flask made of dried crem. Oil is flammable and can be used to fuel oil lanterns, to create dangerous terrain in a space, or as an improvised weapon (sling). When you hit or graze a target with this improvised weapon, you coat the target in oil in addition to the normal damage. Following the attack, regardless of the result, the crem flask breaks and any unused oil is lost.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Poison.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Often manufactured using Roshar’s deadly blackbane plant, poison comes in single-dose glass vials. As </span><span class=\"cosmere-icon\">1</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">, you can pour it into food, liquid, or a container, or you can apply the poison to a melee weapon or a piece of ammunition you’re holding. When you do, the GM may require you to make a Stealth test to avoid discovery. When a character ingests the poison or is hit by an attack using the poisoned weapon or ammunition, the poison is expended, and the character suffers the following effects:</span></p><ul><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Weak Poison.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The target must succeed on a DC 12 Athletics test or take [[/r 1d6]] vital damage.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Effectual Poison.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The target must succeed on a DC 14 Athletics test or take [[/r 2d8]] vital damage and be @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.4BfYSQ4DinrH4dPa.JournalEntryPage.jQvh7ULoKmh49sYA#stunned]{Stunned} for 1 hour.</span></p></li><li><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Potent Poison.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The target must succeed on a DC 16 Athletics test or take [[/r 3d10]] vital damage and be @UUID[Compendium.cosmere-rpg.starter-rules.JournalEntry.4BfYSQ4DinrH4dPa.JournalEntryPage.jQvh7ULoKmh49sYA#stunned]{Stunned} for 1 hour. While Stunned in this way, the target is Immobilized.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Pulley System.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Most commonly used by engineers and artifabrians, this system includes four pulley wheels, 30 feet of rope, and a hook. When you have time to set up a pulley apparatus before lifting an object, you treat the object as being a quarter of its normal weight.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rope.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Rope is usually made of seasilk (or less commonly, lavis grain or rockbud fibers) and sold in 50-foot lengths that can be cut and tied to change its length as needed. It can be cut by dealing 2 damage to it, or it can be ripped apart with a successful DC 20 Athletics test.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Scale.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Most commonly used by scholars, ardents, appraisers, and gem cutters, a scale can accurately determine the weight of an object (to a maximum of 2 pounds).</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Spyglass.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Distant objects viewed through a spyglass can be perceived as though at half the distance. At the GM’s discretion, spyglasses that allow distant objects to appear even closer may be available at higher prices.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Surgical Supplies.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This satchel contains enough bandages, salves, splints, and other medical supplies to be used 10 times. When you make a Medicine test to treat a wounded character (or to similarly use these medical supplies), you can expend one of these uses to gain an advantage on the test.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Treatment (medical).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Rosharan surgeons treat ailments with a variety of treatments, generally made from bitterleaf or bloodivy. During a short rest, you can use a dose of such a treatment to cure a character of one of the following conditions, given that its source isn’t a permanent injury: Disoriented, Exhausted (reduces the penalty by 1), or Stunned.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Tuning Fork.</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A tuning fork can transfer Stormlight from one sphere or gemstone to another. While using a tuning fork, you can use spheres to recharge fabrials, Shardplate, and half-shards as if the spheres were unencased gemstones.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Unencased Gem (infused).</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Unlike spheres with gemstones encased in glass, unencased gems leak Stormlight quickly, going dun within several days depending on their cut. This permeability allows unencased gems to recharge fabrials and Shardplate. Radiants can also breathe in Stormlight from unencased gems as if they were spheres, gaining the same benefit.</span></p></div>"
